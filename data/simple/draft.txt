//Hybrid continents represent a set of contients. They are used when playoff matches are still to 
//be played between several teams that are not yet qualified for the draft
//Example : qatar2022, draft occured before decisive matches between Saudi Arabia/Australia/Peru.
//So the hypothetical team represented by one of these three in the draft must be
//placed in a group such that whoever wins the playoff, the WC group will respect continental constraints.
//In previous example, the "Saudi Arabia/Australia/Peru" could not fall in a group containing asian or south-american team.

//Example: if there are you define "Number of mono-continents,3" and  "Hybrid continents,0-1,0-2,", then
// 0,1,2 are mono-contients, while 3 is gonna be an hybrid continent uniting mono-continents 0 and 1,
// and 4 is gonna be an hybrid continent uniting mono-continents 0 and 2.

//Put the teams in pot order (the nbGroups first teams will be in first pot, then the next nbGroups teams will be in second pot, etc)
//They must all be followed by their continent id (seperated by comma)
//To choose which team(s) is(are) host(s), place it(them) first. Hosts are always in pot 1,
