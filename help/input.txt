Input: a combination of scenarios
Output: the probability that one of these scenarios happens

Input detail:

Five sets of values separated with 4 commas: subset of group letters, subset of pot 1, subset of pot 2, subset of pot 3, subset of pot 4
Group letters/teams of same pot can be enumerated with "/". You can also use a wild card "*" to denote any possible value.
Examples (assuming qatar2022 dataset):
*,France,*,*,Ghana -> will display the probability that France and Ghana end in the same group.
C,*,Uruguay/Mexico,Serbia,* -> will display the probability that Serbia and either one of Uruguay and Mexico end in group C.

To minimize typing, you can type a prefix of the name of a team instead of its full name.
Also, input is not case sensitive.
*,Br,cro/Germa/n,*,sAu -> is equivalent to *,Brazil,Croatia/Germany/Netherlands,*,Saudi Arabia
*,*,Ne,*,Ca -> will return an error since Ca is ambiguous between Canada and Cameroon

Note: don't add any spaces other than those already present in the name of a country.

Note: at least one of the subset must contain a single element (no enumeration,no wild card).
Reason: it's too complicated for this app to calculate probabilities for scenarios which do not share a common element.
Examples:
*,*,*,Sen,Can/Ec -> Ok, will be computed because Senegal appears without any other team of its pot.
B/F,arg/bra,*,Mor/Jap,* -> will return an error.
